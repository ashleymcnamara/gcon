                <p>Hosted each summer in Denver, Colorado, GopherCon started in 2014, with an amazing first year attendance of over 700 people.  Since then, we've doubled in attendance.  We expect to sell out early this year, with a maximum capacity of 1500 people.  Don't wait for the last minute to buy your tickets.  We'd hate for you to be sad.</p>
